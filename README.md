## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
[https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_colors.asp, https://www.w3schools.com/colors/color_tryit.asp?color=Chocolate, https://www.w3schools.com/, https://stackoverflow.com/, https://www.youtube.com/]

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 

The main challenge I had encountered was with the start-stop functionality. When I first built the entire program, I was having trouble with how to switch back and forth from the stop and start functions. It took me having to redo the project from scratch and finding that I made a small error such as wrong {} were used in places that did not need them and had some problems with the semicolons as well.
The main problem on top of this was that I did not know how to use the syntax very well. I have worked with JavaScript but never with HTML or CSS. So, it took a lot longer for me to work on the syntax and try to remember the exact functions and what they did for each. I looked at online resources such as W3schools and StackOverflow for help in understanding the functions and syntax which helped me solidify my understanding of the languages. The start and stop functions were a bit easier to understand and work with after learning the syntax and then I also watch a YouTube video to learn more about implementing them. I understood how to write the functions for the stop and start buttons better after reviewing the material given and watching YouTube videos. Overall, this was a tough but very exciting project to work on and I am excited to work more on Web development.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words)

The main thing I am curious about is how are technologies determined when you first design a website. There must be some sort of language that is also used within the basic web development languages. Also, what sort of security is used for the website to protect itself against attacks. Such credit card companies and their website must require a second sort of database to filter the attacks and mitigate them. Another question also arises such as how do you keep the websites updated and how does it affect the current usage, say a website need to be updated do you close it for the entire day or just update it as is. I believe that there also must be some sort of data storage for this to happen. How do you access this and make changes on a daily as well? 

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

The main thing I would change if I had more time would be the layout of the buttons. The buttons I would like to change to more of a circle format and move them closer together. Also, I would change their frequencies and also try to add music when pressed. For this, to work I would try to look up buttons functionality and try to use built-in JavaScript functions to make it. The last thing I would try to change would be the overall design of the website. Such as adding in levels and maybe adding in a disrupter to move things around as when a button is clicked it would move around the page to another spot so this would change the game drastically.
